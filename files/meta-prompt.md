PROJECT NAME:
P4N4 — Platform for Nexus Neural Network Nodes

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

P4N4 is a developer platform designed for IoT and Edge AI engineers. It bootstraps a complete development environment by combining the MING stack with Edge AI tooling and Gen AI services.

The platform integrates:

* MING Stack:

  * MQTT (device messaging)
  * InfluxDB (time-series storage)
  * Node-RED (visual flow orchestration)
  * Grafana (monitoring & dashboards)

* Edge AI:

  * Edge Impulse integration for on-device ML model deployment and inference.

* Gen AI Layer:

  * n8n (automation workflows)
  * Letta (agent memory and orchestration)
  * Ollama (local LLM execution)

Core idea:
Provide a unified platform to rapidly bootstrap edge AI systems, allowing engineers to connect devices, process data pipelines, deploy ML models to edge nodes, and enable AI-driven automation and natural language interfaces.

TARGET AUDIENCE:

* IoT engineers
* Edge AI developers
* Robotics engineers
* DevOps / MLOps engineers
* AI builders interested in local-first or edge-native architectures.

DESIGN GOALS:

* Modern developer-focused aesthetic (similar to Vercel, Raycast, Modal, or Replicate)
* Clean, minimal, high-tech look.
* Avoid corporate marketing fluff; prioritize technical clarity.
* Should feel like a serious open-source infrastructure project.

LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE:

1. Hero section:

   * Strong tagline explaining what P4N4 is.
   * One-sentence technical positioning.
   * Primary CTA (Get Started / GitHub / Docs).
   * Secondary CTA (Architecture overview).

2. Concept explanation:

   * What is "Nexus Neural Network Nodes".
   * Distributed edge intelligence concept.

3. Architecture section:
   Visual or structured explanation showing:

   Devices → MQTT → Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana
   Edge Impulse → On-device inference
   Gen AI Layer (n8n + Letta + Ollama) for automation & agents.

4. Key features:

   * Unified bootstrap environment
   * Edge-native AI pipelines
   * Local-first AI
   * Modular stack
   * Developer-first workflows.

5. Use cases:

   * Smart sensors
   * Robotics
   * Industrial monitoring
   * Home automation
   * AI agents controlling real-world systems.

6. Developer Experience:

   * Docker-first setup
   * Rapid deployment
   * Extensible architecture.

7. Open-source positioning.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

* Provide full landing page content.
* Include headings, subheadings, section text, and suggested UI structure.
* Include example React/Tailwind component structure if applicable.
* Write in a concise, technical tone suitable for experienced engineers.

Avoid hype-heavy marketing language.
Focus on clarity, architecture, and technical credibility.
