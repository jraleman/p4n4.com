## Overview

**p4n4** is a revolutionary open-source **Agentic AI Game Engine** that creates persistent, autonomous narrative experiences. Unlike traditional games that pause when you're away, p4n4 features a self-sustaining simulation where your world continues to evolve, characters develop relationships, and stories unfold—even when you're not actively playing.

Built on the powerful [Letta framework](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) with advanced memory block architecture, p4n4 enables truly autonomous AI agents that remember, learn, and grow over time.

### Key Features

- **Persistent World**: Your game world never stops—characters continue their lives, stories progress, and events unfold in real-time
- **Letta-Powered Memory**: Advanced memory block system ensures agents retain long-term memories and evolving personalities
- **Multi-Platform Communication**: Interact seamlessly via Telegram, Email, SMS, Discord, or any communication medium
- **Autonomous Characters**: AI agents with persistent memories, evolving relationships, and independent decision-making
- **Dynamic Narratives**: Stories that adapt and grow based on player choices and autonomous character interactions
- **Cross-Platform Continuity**: Your progress and relationships persist across all communication channels

    C --> K[Persistent World State]
    K --> C
```

### Letta Integration

p4n4 leverages Letta's revolutionary memory architecture:

- **Core Memory**: Fundamental character traits and world state
- **Archival Memory**: Long-term storage of events, relationships, and experiences  
- **Recall Memory**: Context-aware retrieval of relevant past interactions
- **Working Memory**: Active processing of current interactions and decisions

## Use Cases
